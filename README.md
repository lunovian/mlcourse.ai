# mlcourse.ai Exercises

Welcome to the repository for **mlcourse.ai** exercises! This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the assignments, quizzes, and projects from the **mlcourse.ai** open machine learning course. The course is an excellent resource for learning about the foundations of machine learning, data analysis, and various algorithms in Python.

## Overview

Here's a basic template for your `README.md` file, providing an overview of the repositories for the **mlcourse.ai** exercises:

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules. Below is an outline of the topics covered:

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Linear and Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Trees and Random Forests**
5. **Gradient Boosting**
6. **Unsupervised Learning**
7. **Feature Engineering**
8. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

## Exercises

### Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this assignment, we explore the dataset by calculating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and identifying trends in the data.

### Assignment 2: Classification with Logistic Regression

This assignment covers building logistic regression models to solve classification problems and evaluating model performance.

### Quiz 1

Multiple-choice questions testing knowledge on supervised learning, bias-variance tradeoff, and model evaluation metrics.

### Project

A final project focusing on building a machine learning pipeline to solve a real-world problem. It includes data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
